# Process Overview
    
**Visual Flow** jobs and pipelines exist within a certain namespace (project), so the first step in the application
would be to create a project or enter an existing one. Then you need to enter Job Designer to create a job.

**Job Designer** is a graphical user interface used to create, maintain, execute and analyze jobs.
Each job determines the data sources, the required transformations and the destination of data.

**Pipeline designer** is a graphical user interface aimed at managing pipelines. Designing a pipeline is similar
to doing so on a job.

**Important**: When editing stages in the Configuration Panel, to save data a user must click the Confirm
button, otherwise the data will be lost.

**Visual Flow** key functions include but not limited to:

* Create a project which serves as a namespace for jobs and/or pipelines
* Manage project settings
* User access management
* Create/maintain a job in Job Designer
* Job execution and logs analysis
* Create/maintain a pipeline in Pipeline Designer
* Pipeline execution
* Import/Export jobs and pipelines
