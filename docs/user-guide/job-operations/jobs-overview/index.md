# Jobs Overview
Clicking the Jobs menu item leads to the Jobs overview screen, which allows you to see a list of jobs existing
within a project. If a job is used in a pipeline, it is indicated by ![](../../../assets/user-guide-img/image11.png)
(pipeline) icon.
The Jobs overview screen displays the following information:

* Job Name
* Job Last run/Last finished/Last edit
* Job Status
* Resource Utilization (CPU/Memory)
* Available Actions (Run/Job Designer/Logs/Copy/Job History/ Delete)

A job has a certain status at various phases of execution:

* Draft
* Pending
* Running
* Succeeded
* Failed
* Unknown (This status appears very rarely in case of undefined error)

**Notes**:

* The actions availability and, therefore, visibility depends on user authorizations
* One cannot delete a job that compounds a pipeline
